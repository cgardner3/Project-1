				<li>1991 Womens World Cup</li>
					<p>The United States won the 1991 Womens World Cup which took place in China. The funny thing about this World Cup was that it was actually called the M&M Cup. The US defeated Norway by a score of 2-1 with Michelle Akers leading the team with both of the goals in the final as well as 10 goals in the tournament.The United States scored 25 goals in the tournament and only conceded only 5 goals.</p>
				<li>1999 Women's World Cup</li>
					<p>The United States won the 1999 World Cup that took place in the United States. This tournament was a unique one for the women in the sense that this was the first time that anyone had won the World Cup on home soil. The United States defeated China in the finals finally on penalty kicks. However, it was the grit of Michelle Akers playing through chronic fatigue and defending the best player of the tournament, Sun Wen and Kristine Lilly's goal line save that got us to Penalty Kicks. In the end, Brianna Scurry saved one and Brandi Chastain scored the winning kick to win the tournament.</p>
				<li>2015 Women's World Cup</li>
					<p>The United States won their third title in 2015 in Canada. This ended the US's 16 year drought and they became the first team to win three Women's World Cup titles. The United States smashed through the tournament only conceding three goals and scoring 14 goals. Carli Llyod led the way scoring on the team with 6 and Hope Solo anchored the goal with strong performances. There was also breakout performances by Julie Ertz and Morgan Brian.</p>
				<li>2019 Women's World Cup</li>
					<p>The United States dominated the 2019 World Cup that occurred in France. They started the tournament blazing with Alex Morgan scoring 5 goals and the United States scoring 13 against Thailand. The United States defeated the Netherlands in the finals 2-0 with goals by Megan Rapinoe and Rose Lavelle, however they had to take powerhouses along the way to claim the title.
